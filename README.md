# sparrow-hawk-debian

Debian-based BSP for the Sparrow Hawk board.

This repository builds Debian packages, publishes them as an APT repository via GitHub Pages, and produces a bootable Debian OS image.

## APT Repository

The APT repository is available at:

```
https://rcar-community.github.io/sparrow-hawk-debian/<channel>
```

Two channels are provided:

| Channel | Branch | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `main`  | main   | Stable releases |
| `dev`   | dev    | Latest development builds |

## Pre-built OS Image

Download the latest image from the Releases page.:

## Build Locally

### Build the OS image

#### Using docker

```bash
./setup_docker_image.sh
./build_image/build_debian_image/build_with_docker_sparrow-hawk.sh
```

Requires Docker. The script builds a `debian-host-builder` image automatically and runs the build inside it.

#### Without docker

Note:
You need to prepare host pc to build debian image.
There is no guide but dockerfiles may be helpful.

```bash
./build_image/build_debian_image/build_debian_for_sparrow-hawk.sh
```

## Repository Structure
